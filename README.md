# Simple State Machine
## Why "Simple"?
This library was designed to be used in all scenarios where a state machine is
the preferred method of program organization. It can be used to minimize
boilerplate code as you will not have to redefine any of these abstractions
yourself, and the structure of the abstractions themselves are built with
easy to understand execution flow.
## Future development
This is the barebones implementation for now, but more complex additions such as
features may be added in the future.
